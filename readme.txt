Hey there,

just some quick notes on my project submission.

I used different resources to write the code for the bikeshare.py script.

It was very helpful to:
  - use "earlier" sections to try out things
  - google questions I had (thanks for the hint "how to google")

Furthermore I took a look at:
  - The Python Tutorial
  - Official Python Documentation
  - stackoverflow
    - without stackoverflow I would have had a lot of problems to be honest

I also took a look at some other websites but it's not worth to write them down here.

Comments on my project:

- it made a lot of fun to write the script
- it was a really hard job
- according to my personal time availability I had to focus on the projects requirements.
  It would have been fun to make the code more convenient and to try out different things.
  I will do so after finishing the last part.

Feel free to reach out if you have some questions, hopefully everything fits.

Best
Johannes
